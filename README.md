## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **PHP 7.4+** (with `GD` or `Imagick` for image processing and `EXIF` for metadata extraction)
- **Composer** (for dependency management)
- **Web Server** (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or PHP's built-in server for local development

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/photo-album-app.git
   cd photo-album-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install the necessary PHP libraries via Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set up the cache directory:**

   Ensure that the cache directory (`cache/`) exists and is writable:

   ```bash
   mkdir cache
   chmod 775 cache
   ```

4. **Run the application:**

   You can start the application using PHP's built-in server:

   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public
   ```

   Alternatively, configure your web server to serve the `public/` directory as the document root.

### Accessing the Application

Once the application is running, you can access it via your web browser at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Directory Structure

Here is an overview of the application's directory structure:

```
photo-album-app/
├── app/
│   ├── Controllers/
│   ├── Models/
│   ├── Utilities/
├── public/
│   ├── index.php
│   ├── static/           # Cached and resized images
├── views/                 # Blade templates
│   ├── index.blade.php
│   ├── album.blade.php
│   ├── password.blade.php
├── albums/                # Place your albums here
│   ├── example-album/
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   ├── image2.png
│   │   └── meta.md        # Metadata file
├── cache/                 # Blade cache directory
├── composer.json
├── composer.lock
└── README.md
```

### Key Directories

- **`public/`:** Contains the entry point (`index.php`) and serves static files, including resized images.
- **`albums/`:** Place your photo albums here. Each album should be a directory containing your photos and a `meta.md` file for metadata.
- **`views/`:** Contains the Blade templates used for rendering the frontend of the application.
- **`cache/`:** Stores cached views generated by Blade.

## Adding Albums and Photos

To add a new album, create a directory inside the `albums/` folder. Inside this directory, place your high-resolution images. The application will automatically resize and cache the images as needed.

### Example:

1. **Create a new album:**

   ```
   mkdir albums/my-vacation
   ```

2. **Upload photos:**

   Place your images inside the `albums/my-vacation/` directory:

   ```
   albums/my-vacation/
   ├── photo1.jpg
   ├── photo2.png
   └── meta.md
   ```

3. **Access the album:**

   Once the photos are uploaded, you can view the album by navigating to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8000/album/my-vacation
   ```

## Metadata and Password Protection

Each album can have a `meta.md` file that contains metadata about the album. The `meta.md` file uses YAML front matter for metadata and Markdown for content.

### Example `meta.md` File:

```yaml
---
title: My Vacation
date: 2023-08-16
secret: "mypassword"  # Optional: Add a password to protect the album
---
This album contains photos from my vacation to Hawaii.
```

### Metadata Fields:

- **`title`:** The display name of the album.
- **`date`:** The date associated with the album (e.g., when the photos were taken).
- **`secret`:** (Optional) A password that must be entered to view the album.

### Password Protection:

If you add a `secret` field in the `meta.md` file, the album will be password protected. Users will need to enter the correct password to access the album. The password can be stored as plain text or encoded, depending on your preference.

## Theming with Blade

The application uses the Blade templating engine for theming. You can customize the look and feel of the application by modifying the Blade templates in the `views/` directory.

### Available Templates:

- **`index.blade.php`:** The homepage that lists all the albums.
- **`album.blade.php`:** Displays photos within a specific album.
- **`password.blade.php`:** The password prompt for password-protected albums.

### Example of Customizing the Template:

You can modify the `index.blade.php` template to change the layout of the album listing:

```blade
<ul>
    @foreach ($albums as $album)
        <li>
            <a href="/album/{{ urlencode($album['name']) }}">
                {{ $album['title'] }}
            </a> 
            @if ($album['date'])
                - {{ \Carbon\Carbon::parse($album['date'])->format('F j, Y') }}
            @endif
        </li>
    @endforeach
</ul>
```

## Security Features

To prevent brute force attacks on password-protected albums, the application includes the following security features:

1. **Rate Limiting:**
   - The application limits the number of password attempts a user can make. After a set number of failed attempts, the user is temporarily locked out.

2. **CAPTCHA Integration:**
   - You can integrate Google reCAPTCHA into the password form to prevent automated brute force attacks.

3. **IP-Based Blocking:**
   - You can implement IP-based blocking to prevent repeated failed attempts from the same IP address.

4. **Password Hashing:**
   - If you prefer, you can hash the `secret` field in the `meta.md` file using `password_hash()` for added security.

## Using Carbon for Date Formatting

The application uses the Carbon library to format dates in a human-readable format. Carbon is a powerful date and time manipulation library for PHP.

### Example Usage in Blade Templates:

```blade
@if ($album['date'])
    - {{ \Carbon\Carbon::parse($album['date'])->format('F j, Y') }}
@endif
```

You can customize the date format using any valid date format string. For more information on Carbon, refer to the [official documentation](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Blank Page:**
   - Ensure that PHP error reporting is enabled and check the logs for any errors.
   - Make sure that all Composer dependencies are installed.

2. **Images Not Displaying:**
   - Verify that the `public/static/` directory is writable and that images are being cached correctly.
   - Check that the `GD` or `Imagick` extension is installed and enabled in PHP.

3. **Password Not Working:**
   - Ensure that the password in the `meta.md` file matches the one being entered.
   - If you are using a hashed password, make sure to verify it correctly using `password_verify()`.
